If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>.
